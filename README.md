# Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning
The research focuses on fake news detection using machine learning algorithms and the analysis of the 2016 US election dataset. The research examines the use of machine learning approaches to detect fake news, and the 2016 US political campaign dataset was used to help in the analysis. Four machine learning models, including a decision tree, logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, were used in this project to detect and classify false information. The research describes in detail the code for each model with respect to accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1 score, and recall.

Reverse image searchers are introduced as another new characteristic in this research, and they return encrypted images. The research has incorporated a new dimension for the reverse search algorithm. This algorithm offers the most innovative way of verifying visual content and has helped the study consider all other deceptive narrative approaches in images.
